# percentiles

hi, ive something you might be interested in
I want to assign percentiles to rta-valid runs on the website
monthly and all-time
by that I mean I want to be able to say 7:55 rta run is in the 99.5th percentile of all runs
and the 50th percentile is 8:25 rta
guessing the values right now but you get the idea
but obviously I can't brute force calculate it for each run every time a new run is uploaded so I need something better
like building a distribution function based on a given dataset
I tried something myself but not quite happy with it
I know this is something you do so if you find it interesting I could give you a dataset to play around with
